# Basic usage

import {Demo} from '@site/src/components';
import * as demo from '@site/src/examples/basic';

This is the basic example of using `<Autoview />` component.

Most of the work in this example is happening in the `repo.tsx` file, where you bind components to the `JSONSchema` data types.

Further examples will extend this one or will use amazing repo [composition](/docs/entities/components-repo) features.

<Demo {...demo} />
